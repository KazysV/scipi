Public bus transport is a key component of modern urban mobility. Society and the environment
benefit from the reduced congestion, pollution, and energy consumption in cities. However,
bus transport systems are complex and require careful planning and management to
ensure their efficiency and sustainability. Moreover, if provided services are sub-optimal,
people tend to abandon the public transport and return to more individual mobility measures.
This paper presents a review of ideas for improving bus services
 via the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the demand.
There are several limitations: seasonal bursts, periodicities and yadda yadda.
